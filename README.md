# Heart-Disease-Classification-among-patients-using-various-Classification-Algorithms

Fitted different classification models like Logistic Regression,Decision Tree,Random Forest,AdaBoost,XGBoost,KNN and SVC on a Heart disease dataset sourced from Kaggle to determine whether a patient is suffering from a heart issue or not. Performed necessary EDA,data pre-processing, hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation to arrive at the Classification algorithm that best fits the data.  

Description of the dataset:  age - age in years, sex - (1 = male; 0 = female), cp - chest pain type, trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital), chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl, fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false), restecg - resting electrocardiographic results, thalach - maximum heart rate achieved, exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no), oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy, thal - 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect, target - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no).  

After performing all the necessary steps,I came to the conclusion that  KNN algoriythm best interprets the data. All the procedure involved is lucidly shown in the ipnyb file.
